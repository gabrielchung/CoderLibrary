# CoderLibrary

CoderLibrary is a living library for coders built entirely through vibe working. AI will turn human intent into content and improvements. The goal is flow.

This is a project for me to learn more about AI and using it for work. I dedicate this project to the Lord God Almighty and my Savior I serve and live for. May glory be to Him for ever and ever.
